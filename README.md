I Reverse Engineered the wannacry ransomware, and with the knowledge i got decompiling/dissasembling it, i would like to share what i've learned so far, as well as present you guys with a hollistic view of what and how the wannacry ransonware works, thanks!


there are still things to be done, like renaming some functions, creating the logical map of the wannacry ransomware, declare some other functions, etc..., i'll try to do it as soon as possible!

dont take this project as done, i'm still writing it, thanks!

i got  lazy, and started other projects, dont expect this one to continue, sorry.
